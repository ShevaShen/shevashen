I worked for O.school as a lead engineer during my after hours as my part time work. I worked with a group of inspiring people who want to help billions of people unlearn shame, heal from sexual trauma, develop skill sets to communicate what they want and don't want, discover new sexual desires in a LGBTQ-friendly and judgment-free space, and most of all — own their desires.

Here are the things I did in my role.

* Lead website development in Webflow
* Lead web app development with React, Firebase
* Created tracking metrics by using Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, Google Optimize
* General website maintenance
