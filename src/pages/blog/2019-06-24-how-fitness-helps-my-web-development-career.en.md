First of all, the photos here are 5 years apart. The photo on the left was taken in August 2014, and the one on the right was taken in May 2019.

I began this journey the beginning of 2014 when I found myself often feel extremely tired and no energy after a day of sitting in front of a computer. The lower back pain was the thing I have to deal with pretty much every day at the age of only 25. It was not that I worked super hard. I didn't have a clear career goal. And I didn't know if web development was the way to go either.

Then I decided to go to the gym.

Like most of the people who are new to the gym. It wasn’t easy for the first 3 months. But all you need to do is pushing yourself and make it part of your life.

After two years, things started to change slowly. I found myself more energetic, more confident, more focused and much more determined. I started to learn a lot of cool stuff, e.g. React, at my downtime. And I really enjoy what I do now.

Now I am a senior front-end web developer at an amazing company.

A wise people used to say, going to the gym is like spending less than 5% of your time a day but making more than 95% of your life with much better quality. A VERY GOOD DEAL!

PS: Since last year, I changed my daily routine. I wake up at 6 am and go to the gym first thing in the morning. This was probably one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life.
