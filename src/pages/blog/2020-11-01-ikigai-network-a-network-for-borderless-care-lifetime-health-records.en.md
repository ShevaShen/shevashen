I joined Nth Opinion as a UI/UX Lead, Front End Engineer in 2020. I'm working a group of people with incredible talents who want to change the current health care system.

This website, Ikigai Network, if one of the first project I did for Nth Opinion. I developed and launched the site from zero to hero within 3 days, with the help of the marketing and design team.

This site utilizes Gatsby. It's lightning fast and SEO friendly.
