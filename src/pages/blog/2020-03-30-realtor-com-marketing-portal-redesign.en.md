I worked at Realtor.com from 2014 to 2018. First I started as a Web Developer then moved to a Front End Developer role mainly focus on the front end web development for variety of web properties for the B2B marketing team. One my of my recent achievements is the redesign of Realtor.com B2B Marketing Portal.

Here are the things I did in this role:

* Lead front end development in B2B marketing team to support lead generation, company events, sales, customer care, retention
* Architectured the new front end for Realtor.com B2B Marketing Portal
* Created UI components for future internal development use
* Implement animations/interactions from scratch
