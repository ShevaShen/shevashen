I joined m56 Studios after I left realtor.com as a Front End Developer. It was a very memorable adventure as I met so many cool colleagues and working on this Fudos project from scratch.

Here are the things I did in my role.

* Set up new Fudos web app base structure by using CRA, Mobx, Mobx State Stree
* Developed new user interface designs through mock-ups, wireframes, and prototypes for Fudos
* Participated in peer work reviews
